# Hardware Design

## Introduction

This is a collection of all hardware modules I have designed in either Verilog or VHDL.

Verilog modules are part of CE202 Logic Circuits Lab at 
[Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)][1].

VHDL modules are part of CE208 Computer Architecture Lab at 
[Tehran Polytechnic][1].
